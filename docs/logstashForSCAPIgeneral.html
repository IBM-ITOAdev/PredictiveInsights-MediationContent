         <h3>Logstash for SCAPI - Background</h3>

<p>
This document gives some background on using Logstash for mediation with Predictive Insights (PI). For a general understanding of Logstash, see <a href="logstash.net">Logstash</a>. I recommend you spend a little time familiarizing yourself with the concepts there. Logstash, whilst having its roots log processing, is a general purpose data transformer. As such it can be used to transform incoming data streams/formats to those needed by PI. A bonus is that the same skills required to use Logstash over with the sister SCALA product, can be applied to PI.
</p>
<p>
In order to use Logstash for PI mediation you will need these four things
</p>
<ul>
<li>Logstash installed (see Logstash website)</li>
<li>SCAPI Logstash plug-ins installed
<li>the appropriate configuration files - appropriate for your data source and transformation needs</li>
<li>a data source e.g. files, perf.mgmt system</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once you have these, working with your data is essentially a matter of modifying the .conf files for your location - typically specifying various directories, and if desired, specifying additional/alternative groups and metrics, following the patterns in the files.  Looking at specific mediation examples should be enough to get you going
</p>

<h3>SCAPI Logstash plug-ins</h3>
<p>
In addition to base Logstash capability, there are a number of custom plugins which we have created. These provide functionality to make it easier to https://developer.ibm.com/itoa/resources/logstash-plugins/use Logstash with PI, e.g. <code>scacsv</code> which outputs files compliant with PI requirements, as well as plugins specific to format e.g. <code>scabmcfile</code> which encapsulate significant amounts of functionality particular to a a specific data source.
</p>
<p>
The current set of plugins developed specifically for use with SCAPI are described <a href="https://github.com/IBM-ITOAdev/LogstashPlugins/blob/master/docs/readme.html">here</a>
</p>
<p>These plugins should be installed on the system where you will be running Logstash</p>
Installation is simply a matter of downloading the plugin code and placing it in an appropriate directory. The latest plug-ins are available here <a href="https://github.com/IBM-ITOAdev/">LogstashPlugins repository</a>. Each plugin is prefixed by <i>logstash-</i>, and there are <i>inputs, filters</i> and <i>outputs</i>.
Download the entire <i>logstash</i> dir. An easy way from github is to select the 'Download ZIP' button on the right hand side of the page. This will give you a zip file with all the contents. Place the downloaded logstash directory in a location of your choosing e.g.</p>
 <code>/path/to/my/logstashPlugins/logstash</code>
<p>
At runtime you will reference this plugin path as command line argument when you start Logstash
</p>

<h3>Configuration files</h3>
<p>
As is standard with Logstash, configuration files are used to control the behaviour of logstash. These specify the inputs, filters and outputs you wish to use. In the PI context, you will usually use <code>scafile</code> for output, but the inputs and filters will depend on your specific mediation needs.
</p>

<h3>Specific mediations</h3>
<p>
Generally,you'll either be using one of the off-the-shelf mediations or building one yourself. For the off-the-shelf ones, the specific documentation for that format should be enough to get your going. If you want to build a mediatiation yourself there are two levels

<ul>
<li>Assembling the desired configuration (.conf) file from existing plug-ins</li>
<li>Assembling the desired configuration from existing plug-ins and custom ones you create yourself
</ul>

The latter is more complicated and involves writing Ruby code. See <a href="http://logstash.net/docs/1.4.2/extending/">'Extending Logstash'</a> for guidance on how to do this. Also examine the existing plugin set, both the core Logstash ones, and the custom SCAPI-related ones for practical examples.
</p>
<p>
The following example mediations are currently available
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../BMCPatrol/readme.html">BMC Patrol</a></li>
<li><a href="../Topaz/readme.html">Topaz</a></li>
